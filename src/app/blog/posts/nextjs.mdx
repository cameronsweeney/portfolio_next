## So I moved all my code for this portfolio into Next.js

## first create-react-app, then Vite.... will I actually like Next.js??

It was cool! Idk I was really confused at first but once I realized how they did routing I enjoyed it. SO much easier to use than ReactRouter, and it's nice to be able to share layouts across pages.

The Hot Reload (??? w/e it's called) is a great development cycle (close the feedback loop!!!!! -> connection to gamification) & I didn't want to lose that. Also you can't really run React locally without using one of those

As with all Typescript stuff it will yell a lot of warnings at you... I found these errors/warnings okay to deal with. You do need to be ready to write a lot of random Typescript types/interfaces for every single object you use but thankfully ChatGPT is really good at that!! (It's just text transformations -> they can turn an example object into a type description and vice versa!)

Better than bundling a React app & serving it with Django, especially if you're going to put any images/static files in it.

## unexpected bonuses, style-wise

Handling fonts and images is nice too, though I had some difficulty getting an SVG to render a font imported through Next.

Still getting the hang of Tailwind, it can't do everything I want super easily so I've ended up doing a mix of Tailwind classes and CSS modules. I like the way Next.js 

## example MDX blog was also real easy to implement (link to example)

I much prefer writing these posts in Markdown than in HTML!! It's also much easier to read without all those HTML tags cluttering things up. For a blog post it feels like a little bit of overkill.

## put in a couple example React components into this blog post just to show off

wow look at what I can do!!!
