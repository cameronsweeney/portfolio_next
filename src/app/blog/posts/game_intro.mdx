# Life Gamification

Hi everyone this will be chaotic. That's kind of the point.

So I've been trying to restructure my life because of burnout & also neurodivergence & I decided to gamify every aspect of my life. Mostly I started with the question of how to prioritize tasks because it's hard to decide on the next thing to do when there's like 100 tasks that are all very urgent. Or *feel* very urgent.

I learned that there's a phrase for this feeling: task saturation. It's not pleasant.

Here is a real-life, definitely not AI-generated picture of me running from the task saturation monster:

You may be familiar with the feeling of task saturation. For me it took the form of endless to-do lists that I couldn't ever really get a grip on. Even when I finished a lot of stuff

Even just calling this new productivity system a "game" has been helpful - designing new systems is an inherently creative and playful process, and gamification is a great way to engage those parts of your brain.

I had already been using index cards to organize many of my recurring tasks - this was helpful for me because I didn't have to see every individual task at once, like with a long, long to-do list. A thick stack of index cards could be overwhelming in the same way, but I can only see the text from the top card.

But I could do better than just some nondescript index cards with task names on them. I had to ask myself: how can I make this system more engaging / more inviting / less overwhelming? How can I make the act of sorting and choosing cards feel more like a *game*?

I decided to upcycle some old Pok√©mon cards laying around - now that's more like a game! I chose to start with energy cards cause they're abundant and identical. But oh no!!! How do I choose what types to use for each different task??? (To be answered in another blog post maybe??? I don't know).

I also decided to design a reward system to encourage myself to complete tasks. As I finished tasks and put them in the "done" pile, I could see a physical representation of my progress throughout the day, and I give myself a point for each task I complete. (this also needs more elaboration)
