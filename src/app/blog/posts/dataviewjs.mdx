## Inspiration / references

- link to original post where code is found
- also the whole progress.dev site/repo
- include a screenshot of a collectathon i love, with the 100% or some other visual completion thing

## Why do

- visualize & externalize everything
- automate is gr8
- dopamine, i am a completionist
- too complex for a bullet journal layout, but i want something like a two-page weekly spread

## How do (gamify/design)

- decide on helpful chunks
    - miniweeks
        - needed something between daily & weekly
        - there's so many weekly tasks that looking at all of them at once is overwhelming
        - some of them are scheduled on specific days, some of them can be done any time, some of them have a soft deadline (cleaning), some of them i want to get in the habit of doing on the same day each week
    - worlds/regions
        - these are more thematically tied together
        - separates out work from life from other stuff
        - if i have beach and/or creek done for current miniweek, i will feel less stressful
            - but i have to KNOW and SHOW to myself that i have done these things
- these are also the 2 ways I want to choose what task/project to tackle next

## How do (code)

- some for loops, basically
- DataviewJS's code is a little strange but here's how to query tasks on current page
- here are how inline task properties work (eg world:: creek, miniweek:: Montuesday)
- alternative: how to query tasks on a separate page
- alternative alternative: how to query tasks on all pages tagged with a specific tag
