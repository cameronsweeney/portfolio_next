# Getting ChatGPT to do the heavy lifting for you

- part of prompt engineering class at Multiverse (link)
- process automation


## here are the steps to follow

https://publish.obsidian.md/themultiverseschool/Curriculum/Autonomous+Agents/Prompt+Engineering/Workshop+3+-+Thought+Architectures+and+Augmented+Skills

- PHASE 1: first pick your project. I did a video game database.
    - Everything is just a prototype! (gamification)
- PHASE 2: start with minimum requirements spec
    - remember, you can always add features later if you think of them. it doesn't have to be everything. JUST the minimum viable
    - this includes user stories if you want to write them that way
    - mainly: data requirements, ui requirements, list of features, list of pages (bundles of user stories)
- PHASE 3: data sourcing (example data - I skipped this step)
- PHASE 4: next up: database design / data design schema
    - LLMs can turn a brain dump into an SQL schema pretty easily.
    - it can also suggest fields/columns for you
    - or ask you questions about what you want
    - Neon has free database hosting. There are probably other places, or if you're not planning on hosting it you can have a database on your computer
    - SQLChat can even execute commands for you
- PHASE 5: REST API
    - generate this from minimum spec
    - using FastAPI because, well, it is fast. but ChatGPT has read lots of code for other backends, too. I did find myself missing the Django ORM here
- PHASE 6: UI
    - feed it everything so far
    - give it choices / frameworks / a template if you want
- PHASE 7: TEST & DEPLOY
    - test locally (you can ask ChatGPT how to run the server)
    - make sure the pieces play well together
    - put it in a git repo & push it to github


## difficulties / problems that may arise

### so llms aren't deterministic & they make mistakes. what then??

- chatgpt can create at the speed of light (almost) - much faster than we can read
- how much of a framework do i need to know to do this?
- how much do i have to read to make sure i catch the big errors?
- general debugging process is important. chatgpt can catch lots of errors but sometimes it just gives generic advice not tailored to whatever's going on in your case

### open-source models don't always do as well with these tasks, or aren't as consistent

### this may not feel very fast the first time you do it. will it feel faster the next time? would it be much faster when Autogen does this for you?
